XPX is a CounterStrikeSharp plugin for Counter-Strike 2 that adds a full server-side progression layer:

- level and XP progression up to level `500`
- rank, top list, tags, and level rewards
- persistent SQLite-backed player data
- missions, achievements, stats, economy, shop, crates, and XP boosts
- RTV and admin map voting
- admin tools for maps, modes, XP, credits, bots, and special rounds
- forced global loadout modes for rifle, pistol, or knife-only servers

The plugin is designed for self-hosted CS2 community servers and is currently deployed with a local Windows + SteamCMD setup.

## Requirements

- Counter-Strike 2 dedicated server
- CounterStrikeSharp
- .NET 8 SDK for local builds
- Windows PowerShell if you want to use the included deploy script as-is

NuGet packages used by this project:

- `CounterStrikeSharp.API 1.0.364`
- `Dapper 2.1.72`
- `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.5`

## Install Options

### Option A: Clone the repo

If you have repository access, clone it normally:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Azuyah/XPX.git
cd XPX
```

### Option B: Manual install from a ZIP

If you do not have repository access, you cannot clone a private repo directly.

Use one of these instead:

1. download a provided release ZIP
2. get a plugin ZIP directly from the maintainer
3. extract it locally
4. copy the plugin files into your CS2 CounterStrikeSharp plugin folder

Recommended current package name:

```text
XPX-v1.0.2-plugin.zip
```

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the manual install path.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the plugin

```powershell
dotnet build
```

### 2. Deploy it

If your server layout matches the current local setup, use:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy-to-r-server.ps1
```

By default the deploy script targets:

- server root: `R:\cs2-ds`
- plugin path: `R:\cs2-ds\game\csgo\addons\counterstrikesharp\plugins\XPXLevels`
- config path: `R:\cs2-ds\game\csgo\addons\counterstrikesharp\configs\plugins\XPXLevels\XPXLevels.json`
- data path: `R:\cs2-ds\game\csgo\addons\counterstrikesharp\data\XPXLevels`

### 3. Join the server

Typical local connect:

```text
connect 127.0.0.1:27015
```

## Main Commands

### Player commands

- `!me`
- `!help`
- `!commands`

- `!missions`
- `!achievements`
- `!shop`
- `!wallet`
- `!inventory` / `!inv`
- `!rtv`
- `!vote`

For the complete command reference, see [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md).

## Configuration

XPX is driven by `XPXLevels.json`. The config covers:

- XP curve and max level
- XP rewards and credits rewards
- mission definitions
- achievement definitions
- shop items
- crate definitions
- map pool and workshop map pool
- admin XP quick-amount presets
- level reward ladder
- welcome messages

For a detailed config guide, see [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Persistence

XPX stores player progression in SQLite by SteamID. It persists:

- XP
- level-derived state
- Credits
- crate tokens
- XP boosts
- stats
- missions
- achievements

The live DB path used by the deploy script is:

```text
game\csgo\addons\counterstrikesharp\data\XPXLevels\xpx-levels.db
```

XPX also keeps a short-lived transition snapshot during map changes to protect player XP from map-switch reload edge cases.

## Repository Layout

## Development

Common local workflow:

```powershell
dotnet build
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy-to-r-server.ps1
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push origin main
```

## Notes

- XPX uses custom numbered center menus with `1-9`, plus `!1-!9` chat fallback.
- Workshop maps are supported by workshop ID.
- Local non-workshop custom maps require separate client distribution and are not the preferred path.
- The project currently targets a Windows-hosted local CS2 dedicated server workflow.
