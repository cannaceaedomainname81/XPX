## Menu Controls

XPX uses numbered center menus.

### Keys

- `1-6` select visible items
- `7` is `Back` on page 1, or `Prev` on later pages
- `8` is `Next`
- `9` is `Close`

### Fallback

If your `1-9` binds are not set up, you can use:

- `!1`
- `!2`
- `!3`
- `...`
- `!9`

while a menu is open.

## Notes

- Some commands are chat-first and intended for players.
- Admin commands still work from console even if the matching chat/menu flow is the more common path.
- The shop currently includes crate access; `!crate` is no longer the public flow.
